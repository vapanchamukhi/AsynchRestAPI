Five ways of creating Async APIs.
  **@Async and CompletableFuture**: Easy to use, suitable for simple use cases.
  **Spring WebFlux**: Best for high scalability and non-blocking I/O operations.
  **Callable**: Simple and effective for basic asynchronous processing.
  **DeferredResult**: More control over the lifecycle of the asynchronous processing.
  **CompletableFuture with Spring MVC**: Flexible and powerful for complex asynchronous tasks.
